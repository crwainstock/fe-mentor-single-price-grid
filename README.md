# Frontend Mentor - Single price grid component

![Design preview for the Single price grid component coding challenge](./Project%20Requirements/design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## üåç Overview

This little component is a beginner project from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/single-price-grid-component-5ce41129d0ff452fec5abbbc/hub). I wanted to build this project to stay connected to my CSS skills.

As with any skill, if you don't use it, you lose it. üò´ So this little build is a part of my ongoing professional development.

You can see a couple of other little, baby builds [here](https://github.com/crwainstock/fe-mentor-qr) and [here](https://github.com/crwainstock/fe-mentor-3-column-preview-card).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Dependencies

This component was built with HTML and vanilla CSS. No dependencies! ü•≥ I also used [PerfectPixel](https://www.welldonecode.com/perfectpixel/) and the [Eye Dropper/Color Picker](https://eyedropper.org/) browser extensions to help with the build.

I deployed the component with Netlify, though, so check that out [here](https://calm-dieffenbachia-b70c56.netlify.app/).

I used [ezgif.com](https://ezgif.com/video-to-gif) to convert videos to gifs to show here.

## ü§î Reflection

Alright, this little cutie was a good refresher on using [grid](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp) to arrange parts of the component. It took a minute to get things in the right place, to the right size.

I started with the mobile version for this build, and it was good practice in doing mobile-first. I was a little worried it would be confusing to have the default styling be for mobile, but it was totally fine. I'll keep using this strategy going forward.

I also used [box-sizing](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_box-sizing.asp) to help get the sizing and padding right. It was really useful with this build.

Text sizing was quite tedious, again, with this build. Maybe there's a better way to know how large to make each font in future builds. With a Figma file or style guide, font sizing would maybe be more transparent. With this build, though, I was just guessing and then resizing based on the images from the brief.

## üëÄ Demo & Live Version

Check out the live version of this component [here](https://calm-dieffenbachia-b70c56.netlify.app/).

And here are a couple gifs showing the final build. First, what the component looks like on larger screens compared to the image in the brief. Then, the component resizing across different screen sizes.
