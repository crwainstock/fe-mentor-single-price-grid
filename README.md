# Frontend Mentor - Single price grid component

![Design preview for the Single price grid component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## üåç Overview

This little component is a beginner project from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/single-price-grid-component-5ce41129d0ff452fec5abbbc/hub). I wanted to build this project to stay connected to my CSS skills.

As with any skill, if you don't use it, you lose it. üò´ So this little build is a part of my ongoing professional development.

You can see a couple of other little, baby builds [here](https://github.com/crwainstock/fe-mentor-qr) and [here](https://github.com/crwainstock/fe-mentor-3-column-preview-card).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Dependencies

This component was built with HTML and vanilla CSS. No dependencies! ü•≥ I also used [PerfectPixel](https://www.welldonecode.com/perfectpixel/) and the [Eye Dropper/Color Picker](https://eyedropper.org/) browser extensions to help with the build.

I deployed the component with Netlify, though, so check that out [here](https://calm-dieffenbachia-b70c56.netlify.app/).

I used [ezgif.com](https://ezgif.com/video-to-gif) to convert videos to gifs to show here.
